HGI-Arvada is one block from the RTD Olde Town Arvada train station, which is approximately 90 minutes to/from Denver International Airport with a transfer at Union Station from the A-line to the G-line. It is in the midst of Olde Town Arvada dining and shopping, and a short train ride into downtown Denver.

The Saturday plenary will be given by Amy C. Cottrill  (Birmingham-Southern College), who will share something related to her recent book Uncovering Violence: Reading Biblical Narratives as an Ethical Project.
